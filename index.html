                      <p>Building something great and lasting takes time, the Great Wall took hundreds of years. Don't worry! Building a great website won't take nearly that long (maybe only a few years). I want to take your vision for your website and make it out of sight.</p>
                      <p>Of all the things you should know about me is that I love coding! What is coding, you say? Coding is that fancy word for building your website. You know, HTML, CSS, Java...<em> WAIT!</em> That's not what you know, that's what I know. Silly me. Well, you probably know what a cup of Java but that's not the same thing now is it? But they do go really well together! Let's get on with it. Check out my skilz (not my spelling).</p>

                        <h4>HTML</h4>
                        <p>Despite poplular opinion, building websites is not rocket science, it's an art. If you could see my HTML you'd be like...dang. I love this stuff (so you don't have to!).

                        <h4>CSS</h4>
                        <p>This is the funner stuff that I get to do. I'll tell you the secret of great looking websites...um, nvmd. Suffice to say, I'll use this CSS stuff to make your site, out of sight (kinda like the Great Wall from outer space. Ok, that didn't work, but you get the point. This is the longest parentheses).</p>

                        <h4>Hawk-eye for Detail</h4>
                        <p>It's said, "Don't miss the forest for the trees." Seeing the big picture of your website is indespensible. Yet, you can't have a big picture without the pixels...the <em> details</em>. That's where my hawk-eye for detail comes into the pixel (get it?! pixel?!) NVMD. On to more professional thing-a-ma-bob-ers.</p>
